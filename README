The WRF Testing Framework is designed to build, test, and analyze test results for 
one or more versions of the WRF model.   It supports the testing of various "flavors"
of WRF, including the ARW model, NMM model, and WRF-Chem.  It also supports
the comparison of results for different software revisions of the same model;
for example, test results for version 3.4.1 of WRF can be compared against 
an updated version of WRF.   Finally, for users with access to Matlab, test results
can be summarized in a single plot, which gives a summary overview of results.


The WRF Testing Framework has been designed so that only a single "master control file", 
from now on referred to as a "WRF Test File", needs to be modified by the user.   
This file specifies which "flavors" of WRF should be built, which compiler options
to use, whether to build WRF with optimizations turned on, etc.   


The file structure of the WRF Test Framework is as follows:

=================================================================================================
                                       STEPS TO RUN
=================================================================================================

1)   Place one or more WRF source tar files in the "tarballs" directory.  Each file
     must end in "*.tar" (case sensitive), and the tarfile names should not contain spaces. 
     IMPORTANT: each WRF tarfile must create the directory "WRFV3" when unpacked.  Otherwise, 
     the script will fail.  

2)   Create or modify a WRF Test File.  This file must end in "*.wtf"  (case sensitive). 
     Lengthy explanations are given in existing WRF Test Files for each parameter.  
     The most important parameters to check are near the top of the file.
     
3)   Make sure that you have selected the proper compiler environment within your shell!
     On Yellowstone, this means running "module list" and possibly "module swap intel pgi"
     to use the PGI compiler instead of the default Intel compiler. 

4)   In the top-level directory, issue the command:

       "scripts/run_WRF_Tests.ksh -R <WRF_Test_File>.wtf >& run.log &"


You can issue the command "tail -f run.log" to check the progress of the script.   There will 
be some long pauses in the log file output at two different times:  while the WRF code is 
unpacked and compiled (look in the build directories for compilation logs), and after all the 
WRF runs have completed when all the WRF output files are checked for invalid values (NaNs).   

When the top-level command  has completed,  results will be summarized in the directory Runs/RESULTS. 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WRF Test Framework (WTF) performs three major steps, in consecutive order, for each WRF
source tar file placed in "tarballs": 

1)  Unpacks and compiles all desired WRF flavors.  On a computer with a batch queue, these 
    happen simultaneously.   On a personal computer, each WRF build is performed consecutively.
2)  Runs tests for all successfully built WRF executables.  Again, if a batch queue is 
    available for testing, these tests are queued simultaneously; otherwise, tests are run
    consecutively. 
3)  Evaluates which tests passed or failed and creates a time-stamped summary file in 
    "Runs/RESULTS".

WTF is designed for incremental development and testing, which means these steps can be repeated as 
many times as the user wishes in the case that some builds or tests fail.  If a compilation or test 
fails, re-running WTF will attempt to recompile failed builds and re-run failed tests.  Any successful 
outcomes, whether in compiling WRF or in passing tests, are not retried on successive WTF invocations.  
If a user wishes to repeat a successful build, it is sufficient to either delete the created source 
directory or run "./clean -a" to remove the compilation output.  If a user wishes to repeat a 
successful test, it is sufficient to delete the "wrfout*" output file. 

If one or more WRF builds fails, the source can be modified by hand and the WTF command run again in order 
to retry a compilation.  If one or more tests fail, re-running WTF will cause these tests to be 
tried again.   Each time the scripts are run, a PASS/FAIL summary file is created in Runs/RESULTS 
with the current state of the compilation and test outcomes.   

If a test fails because of a bug in a successfully built WRF program, the user can go into the 
appropriate source directory, modify the code, and either recompile by hand or rerun the scripts to 
generate a new wrf.exe file.  For WTF to recompile the source, the old wrf.exe executable must be removed.  
The scripts simply invoke the "configure" and "compile" commands to generate a wrf.exe file.  
If "real.exe" and "wrf.exe" are both created, the compilation is deemed successful, and any 
non-successful tests for this executable are later performed.  

WTF performs checks on WRF output to see if forecasts look valid, and to see if the same output is
produced for serial and parallel versions of WRF.   The serial vs. parallel output check (also 
called a bit-for-bit check) is only performed if both the serial and parallel forecasts look valid. 
Otherwise, the check is skipped.  The summary file WILL contain information about the forecast 
results being invalid.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO FIND THE SOURCE FOR A WRF BUILD
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WTF is designed to build many versions of WRF at once, so each WRF build takes place in its 
own designated directory location.   Each WRF source tarfile is unpacked in a directory with the name :

"Builds/<WRF_TARFILE_NAME>.<CONFIGURE_OPTION>/<WRF_FLAVOR>/WRFV3".  

For example, suppose you place the WRF tarfile "wrf_Goober.tar" in the directory "tarballs", and 
you intend to build WRF-ARW serially using the Intel compiler on Yellowstone.  It turns out that 
configure expects you to enter the number "17" (as of January 10, 2013) to build this version of WRF.  
Then the WRF source will be unpacked in the directory "Builds/wrf_Goober.17/em_real/WRFV3".  
 
As another example, suppose you place another WRF tarfile "wrf_trunk_122112_05_dg.tar" in the 
directory "tarballs", and you intend to build WRF-CHEM with MPI using the PGI compiler on 
Yellowstone.  It turns out that configure expects you to enter the number "3" (as of January 10, 2013) 
to build this version of WRF.  Then the WRF source will be unpacked in the directory 
"Builds/wrf_trunk_122112_05_dg.3/em_chem/WRFV3".  
 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE TO FIND THE TESTS FOR A WRF BUILD
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WTF is designed to run many tests for each WRF executable.  Each test is embodied in a single namelist
file of the form "namelist.input.<TAG>".   The particular tests that are run depend on which 
"namelist directory" the user chooses in the WTF configure file.  Suppose the choice in the WTF 
configuration file is:

export NAMELIST_DIR=$WRF_TEST_ROOT/Namelists/weekly

Then all ARW tests are located in $WRF_TEST_ROOT/Namelists/weekly/em_real.   Tests that should 
only be run serially are in the subdirectory $WRF_TEST_ROOT/Namelists/weekly/em_real/SERIAL.  
The same convention exists for tests that should only be run under OpenMP or MPI.    

The directories where tests are all performed, 

perhaps to check output logs or re-run tests by 
hand, 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO INTERPRET JOB CODES FOR BATCH COMPILES AND TESTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eager users may want to monitor the progress of their batch jobs submitted for compiling WRF
or running tests.  Each batch job is given a unique job string, which helps determine what
builds or tests remain unfinished.   On Yellowstone, use the command "bjobs -w" to see all pending
and running jobs and their associated job code strings.   

Build job strings have the form "bld.<WRF_TYPE_ABBREVATION>.<CONFIG#>", where <WRF_TYPE_ABBREVATION>
is a two-letter code, one for each flavor of WRF, and <CONFIG#> is the value given to the "configure"
script.  Codes for different flavors or WRF are: 

       em_real)        typeCode='er'
       em_real8)       typeCode='eR'
       nmm_real)       typeCode='nr'
       nmm_nest)       typeCode='nn'
       nmm_hwrf)       typeCode='nh'
       em_chem)        typeCode='ec'
       em_chem_kpp)    typeCode='ek'
       em_b_wave)      typeCode='eb'
       em_quarter_ss)  typeCode='eq'
       em_quarter_ss8) typeCode='eQ'
       em_hill2d_x)    typeCode='eh'
       em_move)        typeCode='em'
       wrfda_3dvar)    typeCode='3d'
       wrfplus)        typeCode='wp'
       wrfda_4dvar)    typeCode='4d'

For example, the job string given for building the MPI version of "em_real" using the PGI compiler 
on yellowstone would be "bld.er.3", since "3" is the value passed to "configure" to select the PGI
compiler building the MPI version of WRF.  
 

Test job strings have the form "t.<WRF_TYPE_ABBREVATION>.<PARALLEL_TYPE>.<NAMELIST_SUFFIX>".  The
<WRF_TYPE_ABBREVIATION> codes are the same as for builds.   The <PARALLEL_TYPE> is either "se" for
a serial test, "sm" for an OpenMP (shared memory) test, or "dm" for an MPI (distributed memory) test.
The <NAMELIST_SUFFIX> code is simply the string that appears at the end of the namelist file, which
always has the form "namelist.input.<SUFFIX>".   

For example, the job string given for running an NMM MPI test on the file namelist.input.5A would 
be "t.nr.dm.5A".  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO ADD METEOROLOGICAL DATA FOR A NEW TEST DOMAIN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All meteorological data used for testing purposes is located in the directory "Data/<WRF_FLAVOR>".
For example, all WRF-CHEM data is in the directory "Data/em_chem".  For each WRF-CHEM test, all 
files found in this directory are linked into the test directory.   As long as the new domain's 
dates do not conflict with existing tests, adding new domain data is as simple as putting the files
in the Data/em_chem directory. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOME IMPORTANT CAVEATS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WTF is "smart" when it comes to reusing compiled code for related WRF flavors:  idealized 
versions of ARW (em_b_wave and em_quarter_ss) are built in the same source directory as 
regular WRF, and the nested version of NMM-WRF (nmm_nest) is built in the same directory as NMM.   
However, this creates a conflict for the WRF preprocessor executable names: em_b_wave and 
em_quarter_ss normally both create a preprocessor named "ideal.exe", and both versions of NMM 
normally create a preprocessor named "real.exe".  To prevent clobbering of preprocessor 
executables, WTF renames each preprocessor executable to "prewrf_<WRF_FLAVOR>.exe".  If you 
try recompiling WRF source by hand, the scripts will expect this file to exist or will 
perform this renaming for you.  

Remember, WRF tarfiles must unpack the WRF source into a directory named "WRFV3".  

WTF is not designed to build several revisions of WRF simultaneously where the options passed to 
"configure" are different depending on the revision.  If you run into this problem, please 
lobby your local WRF developer committee to prevent changes to configure codes from being accepted.
